# Interactive Storyteller with Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image Models

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Interactive Storyteller project! In this project, we leverage the power of text-to-text and text-to-image large language models to create immersive and interactive stories.

## Overview

Our pipeline involves the following steps:

1. *Input Collection*: Users provide brief inputs about characters, plot, and theme of the story.

2. *Text-to-Text Story Generation*: Using text-to-text large language models, we generate the story based on the provided inputs. The model crafts a narrative that unfolds based on the characters, plot, and theme provided by the user.

3. *Story Division*: The generated story is divided into pivotal sections, ensuring that each section captures a significant moment or development in the narrative.

4. *Text-to-Image Generation*: Each pivotal section of the story is fed into a text-to-image model to generate corresponding images. These images help visualize key scenes and characters from the story.

5. *User Interaction*: Users have the opportunity to review the story. If satisfied, they can proceed with enjoying the image narrative. If not, they can provide feedback on what to edit or improve in the story.

6. *Story Regeneration*: Based on user feedback, the story may undergo regeneration, incorporating suggested edits or improvements. This iterative process ensures that the final story meets the user's expectations.
